# Contributing to Golang Tutorial

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new concept
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.


People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Case 2: Working on existing issue(s)üêõ
- Take a look on the existing issue section. If you can one/more, proceed forward and ask project admin to assign yourself

- Depending upon your expertise/interest click any of them and find issue to solve
- If anyone already assigned already, ask maintainer to assign yourself(if and only if the existing assigned contributor fails to solve the issue)
- After getting assigned yourself, it's your job to showcase your skills to community by contributionsü§πüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
