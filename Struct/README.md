# Struct

## Why to Use Structs

The most obvious reason for why you would want to use a struct is when you have a data type that consists of more than one field.

Structs simplify operations on blocks of data. If your program involves employee data, it makes more sense to keep all the employee data within one entity rather than having separate variables for each piece of data.
