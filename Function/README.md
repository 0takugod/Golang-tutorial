# Functions

## Why to Use Functions

Functions are often blocks of code or statements in a programme that allow the user to reuse the same code, which saves memory, saves time, and, most significantly, improves code readability. A function is essentially a set of statements that perform a certain task and return the outcome to the caller. A function can also do something specific without returning anything.
