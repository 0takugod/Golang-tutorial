## Introduction

Conversions involve changing the type of a value to another type, either implicitly or explicitly. This repository provides examples and explanations for various scenarios where conversions are commonly used in Go.

## Numeric Conversions

Numeric conversions involve converting between different numeric types, such as `int`, `float64`, `uint32`, etc. Learn about type casting, precision considerations, and potential data loss.

## String Conversions

Learn how to convert between strings and other data types, including numbers and non-ASCII characters. Understand encoding and decoding processes for strings.

## Type Assertion

Type assertions allow you to determine the underlying type of an interface and extract its value in the correct type. Explore how to use type assertions effectively.

## Interface Conversions

Understand how to work with interfaces and convert between different interface types. Learn about empty interfaces and type switches.

## Custom Type Conversions

Explore how to define your own custom types and perform conversions between these types and built-in types. Learn about the importance of method receivers in type conversions.

## Pointer Conversions

Pointer conversions involve converting between different pointer types. Learn about pointer dereferencing, type compatibility, and common pitfalls.

## Array and Slice Conversions

Arrays and slices can be converted between each other, and this section explains how to perform such conversions efficiently.

## Map Conversions

Learn about converting between different map types and techniques for copying or merging map data.

## Struct Conversions

Structs can be converted between different types that share the same underlying field structure. Explore techniques for converting between related struct types.

## Time and Duration Conversions

Converting time values and durations between different formats and units is essential when working with time-sensitive applications. Learn how to handle time conversions effectively.
